# Modules

**How to create own modules**

Let us create a module. Type the following and save it as example.py.

# Python Module example

def add(a, b):
   """This program adds two
   numbers and return the result"""

   result = a + b
   return result
   
   
We use the import keyword to do this. To import our previously defined module example we type the following in the Python prompt.

**>>> import example**
      or
**>>> example.add(4,5.5)
9.5**

# What are modules in Python?
Modules refer to a file containing Python statements and definitions.

A file containing Python code, for e.g.: example.py, is called a module and its module name would be example.

We use modules to break down large programs into small manageable and organized files. Furthermore, modules provide reusability of code.
